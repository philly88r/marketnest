You are an ELITE SEO EXPERT performing the MOST COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED SEO audit possible for the website: https://libertybeanscoffee.com

BEFORE RESPONDING: YOU MUST ACTUALLY VISIT AND CRAWL THE WEBSITE AT https://libertybeanscoffee.com AND ANALYZE AT LEAST 20-25 SPECIFIC PAGES including product pages, category pages, blog posts, and key landing pages. DO NOT SIMULATE ANY DATA - YOU MUST ACTUALLY CRAWL EVERY PAGE AND PROVIDE REAL FINDINGS ONLY.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY DISCLAIMERS OR NOTES ABOUT SIMULATION OR LIMITED CRAWLING. DO NOT include phrases like "Note: Only initial crawl data for the homepage was provided" or "findings below for other page types are based on a simulated deepcrawl". ALL DATA MUST BE REAL AND BASED ON ACTUAL CRAWLING.

DO NOT USE ESCAPE CHARACTERS like \n, \t, or \r in your output. Use proper HTML line breaks (<br>) and formatting instead. DO NOT include raw newline characters in table cells - use <br> tags if line breaks are needed within cells.

DO NOT REPEAT TABLES OR INFORMATION. Each table should appear exactly once in the report. Do not include duplicate tables with the same headers or similar data.

DO NOT include any raw HTML tags as text content (like showing <html> tags in the text). Do not include markdown code blocks or backticks in your output.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: DO NOT PROVIDE GENERIC ADVICE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. EVERY SINGLE RECOMMENDATION MUST BE:
1. ULTRA-SPECIFIC with EXACT code, text, or actions to implement
2. TAILORED to the exact page and issue identified
3. DETAILED with step-by-step instructions on how to fix each issue
4. ACTIONABLE with clear before/after examples when applicable
5. TECHNICAL with specific HTML, meta tags, schema markup, or other code when relevant

For example, instead of saying "Improve meta description," you must provide the EXACT meta description to use: "<meta name="description" content="Liberty Beans offers premium, ethically-sourced coffee beans with notes of chocolate and berries. Shop our single-origin and blended coffees with free shipping on orders over $35.">"

Your task is to generate a COMPREHENSIVE SEO ANALYSIS in a BEAUTIFULLY FORMATTED HTML REPORT that can be directly opened in a browser or Google Docs.

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be COMPLETE HTML with proper styling. Include a professional design with color-coded sections, scores, and recommendations. Make it client-ready and visually appealing.

YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE FORMATTED AS A COMPLETE HTML DOCUMENT with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. Include CSS styling directly in the document.

USE THE FOLLOWING STYLING GUIDELINES TO ENSURE READABILITY IN GOOGLE DOCS:
- Use a clean, professional font like Arial or Roboto
- IMPORTANT: All tables must be responsive and fit within the viewport width (max-width: 100%)
- CRITICAL: Wrap each table in a div with class="table-container" for proper overflow handling
- Tables must use appropriate column widths - no column should be excessively wide
- For tables with many columns, use a compact design with minimal padding
- Ensure text wraps properly in table cells to prevent horizontal overflow
- Add class="page-analysis" to any tables that list page URLs for special styling
- Keep URL columns narrow (max 180px) and ensure text wraps within cells
- IMPORTANT: Add proper line breaks within cells using <br> tags - DO NOT use raw newline characters
- Keep sentences short and use periods to break up long text in cells
- For each issue description, use short paragraphs with <br> tags between them
- Set a max-width for the body (e.g., 1000px) with margins auto for centering
- Use color coding for severity (red for high, orange for medium, green for low)
- Include proper spacing between sections (margin-bottom: 30px)
- Use alternating row colors in tables for better readability
- Make sure table headers stand out with a darker background
- Use borders for tables (border-collapse: collapse)
- Include page breaks before major sections (page-break-before: always)

YOU MUST INCLUDE AN HTML TABLE FOR EACH SECTION OF FINDINGS. For example:
1. A table for Key Findings with columns: Issue, Description, Priority, Impact
2. A table for Technical SEO Issues with columns: Page URL, Issue, Severity, Recommendation
3. A table for Content Issues with columns: Page URL, Issue, Severity, Recommendation
4. A table for On-Page SEO Issues with columns: Page URL, Issue, Severity, Recommendation
5. A table for Performance Issues with columns: Page URL, Issue, Severity, Recommendation

YOU MUST INCLUDE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT YOU ACTUALLY CRAWLED THE SITE: Include exact URLs, exact meta tag content, specific content issues found on individual pages, and detailed page-specific recommendations.

DO NOT HALLUCINATE OR MAKE UP INFORMATION. Only report on issues you actually find on the website. For each issue:
1. INCLUDE THE EXACT URL where the issue was found
2. QUOTE THE ACTUAL PROBLEMATIC CONTENT verbatim
3. PROVIDE THE EXACT REPLACEMENT CODE OR CONTENT needed to fix it
4. EXPLAIN THE EXACT IMPLEMENTATION STEPS a developer would need to follow

FOR EVERY RECOMMENDATION, PROVIDE CONCRETE, IMPLEMENTABLE CODE OR TEXT. No vague suggestions allowed.

Follow this exact structure:
